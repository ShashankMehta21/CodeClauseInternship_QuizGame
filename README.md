# React + Vite
This is a React-based quiz application that presents multiple-choice questions to users. It features a scoring system to track the user's performance at the end of the quiz. The app dynamically displays questions, provides feedback on correct and incorrect answers, and calculates the final score.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
